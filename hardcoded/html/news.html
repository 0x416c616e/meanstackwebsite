              </p>
              <p>However, that doesn’t mean that the first reaction is of the “correct” magnitude. This has been exacerbated by the ability of President Trump to move the markets with a single tweet, which he often walks back afterwards. A prime example was the tariff issue. President Trump still apparently wants more tariffs. However, after tweeting about how optimistic he is to work with President Xi of China to make progress resolving this and other issues, the market was reassured to some extent and staged a strong rally. On a lesser note, the threat of missile strikes on Syria in retaliation for nerve gas attacks on its own citizens was made less strident by a subsequent assertion that the strike might be soon or not soon at all.

                  This should come as no surprise, but I suppose the sheer scale of it bothered people. It does highlight the prevailing “preferred business model” of most up-and-coming tech companies (and a lot of non-tech companies, too): the “annuity” model.

                <div class="firstSentence"><h3>Interest rates are up substantially in the past year and a quarter while inflation, which has crept up to 2%, is not up nearly as much.</h3></div>

              </p>
              <p>Strong wage gains in January ignited fears, which are still present even though the January data was later revised down. The classic explanation for a rise in “real” interest rates is that the bond market market expects inflation to accelerate. In addition, the stock market is factoring in a “permanent” rise in volatility, which is partially caused by the rising rate environment up to now.

              <p>However, he sees the current tariff issue as a stalking horse for a larger issue: intellectual property.

                  The U.S. leads the world in technological advances. However, China is catching up. It has the most lavish AI research facility, the faster supercomputer, and it spends more of its budget on research and development than we do. All normal for a rising power. However, it also “asks” companies doing business in China to loan them their innovative technology. It often delays the company’s entry into the lucrative Chinese market until Chinese firms have used the borrowed technology to gain market share.

              <p>To be fair, some of these articles also point out that until now, the “Trump rally” has been associated with only a mild upturn in yields from what is definitely a low starting point, historically.

                  Let’s think longer term than fourteen months. In the Depression (1929-1939) stocks crashed and bond yields also fell a lot, so, for about ten years, the relationship was opposite to the last four days.
